Setting expectations is important. We work like your embedded product team, and we bill between $175 to $225 per hour, pending the tech stack.

Most weeks, we'll bill between 32 and 40 hours per person, and it's pretty rare that a project we take on is under ten person weeks of work. (we're not an agency)
