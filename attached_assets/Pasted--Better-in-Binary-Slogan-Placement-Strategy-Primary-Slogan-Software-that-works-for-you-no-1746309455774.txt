# Better in Binary - Slogan Placement Strategy

## Primary Slogan
**"Software that works for you, not against you"**

This primary slogan communicates your core value proposition and should appear in:

- **Header/Navigation Bar**: As a subtle tagline next to your logo
- **Homepage Hero Section**: As the main headline or prominent subheading
- **Email Signatures**: At the bottom of all company emails
- **Business Cards & Physical Materials**: Alongside your logo
- **Social Media Profiles**: In your bio/about sections
- **Footer**: As a consistent reminder throughout the site

## Secondary Taglines

### About Page
**"Simplicity engineered"**

Placement:
- As the main headline on the About page
- Visually emphasized with your brand colors
- Supported by paragraphs explaining your engineering approach to creating simple solutions
- Could be accompanied by a simple diagram or animation showing how you transform complexity into simplicity

### Services/Solutions Page
**"Solutions that serve, not complicate"**

Placement:
- As the section headline introducing your services
- Repeated as subtle headers for each service category
- Used as a framing device when explaining your approach to solution development
- Could be reinforced with before/after examples of simplified systems

### Portfolio/Case Studies Section
**"We handle the tech, you handle the business"**

Placement:
- As the main headline introducing your case studies/portfolio
- As a recurring theme in the summary of each case study
- Highlighted in client testimonial sections
- Used to frame the results/benefits sections of case studies

### Contact/Get Started Page
**"Clear solutions to complex problems"**

Placement:
- As the headline above your contact form
- Reinforced in the thank you/confirmation message after form submission
- Used in call-to-action buttons ("Get your clear solution today")
- Included in the introductory text explaining your onboarding process

## Additional Strategic Placements

### Blog/Resources Section
Consider using rotating taglines that align with specific content topics. For example:
- For technical topics: "Simplicity engineered"
- For business strategy topics: "We handle the tech, you handle the business"
- For problem-solving articles: "Clear solutions to complex problems"

### FAQ Section
Frame your FAQs around your "Software that works for you, not against you" concept, perhaps with an introduction like:
"Here are answers to common questions about how our software works for your business, never against it."

### Client Onboarding Materials
Use "Simplicity engineered" to frame your onboarding process, emphasizing how you've made even the implementation process simple and straightforward.

### Pricing Page
Use "Solutions that serve, not complicate" to introduce your transparent, straightforward pricing model.

## Visual Implementation

For maximum impact:
- Use your brand typography (Space Grotesk Bold for headlines, Inter for body text)
- Implement your color palette (Emerald #23CE6B for primary emphasis, Purpureus #A846A0 for secondary emphasis)
- Consider subtle animations that reinforce the concept of simplicity (like binary 0s and 1s transforming into a clean solution)
- Use consistent placement and styling of taglines across all pages to build recognition

This multi-slogan approach creates a cohesive narrative throughout the user journey, reinforcing your value proposition at every touchpoint while keeping your messaging fresh and contextually relevant.
